                        Hi, My name is Aliya Faraz Sayyed 👋🏼. I'm a 22 year old Front End Engineer based in Toronto ☀️. I describe myself as a passionate developer who loves coding, open source, and the web platform ❤️.
                        
                        Aside from my job, I like to create and contribute to open source projects. That helps me to learn a ton of new stuff, grow as a developer and support other open source projects. Also I enjoy writing technical things ✍️ at my blog.
                        
                        In my free time you can find me longboarding 🛹 , at the gym 🏋️‍♂️, at the beach 🏖 or on tech meetups and conferences around Toronto and India.</p>
